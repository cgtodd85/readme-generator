# README Generator

## Description

I wanted to create a simple formula for creating a professional README doc. By running this app and entering info at the prompts you will have a professional README of your very own.

## Installation

You can fork this repo and clone it to your machine. Run 'node index' in the file path of the parent folder and follow the prompts. You will need Node.js to be already installed to run. If you do not use the package.json or otherwise do not have inquirer or the node modules installed you will need to run the following:

npm init -y
npm inquirer

## Usage

Usage should be straightforward but feel free to contact me with any questions.

## Contributing

No other contributors

## Tests

undefined

## Development

There are only a limited amount of licenses to choose from. That is one area that can be expanded in future development.
